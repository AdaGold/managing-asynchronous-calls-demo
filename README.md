# Managing Asynchronous Calls Demo

This is an example repo for students to practice asynchronous requests using Axios and JavaScript.

1. Before starting, run `npm install` or `npm i` to install dependencies.

2. Open up `src/index.js` to see the code.

3. Use `npm start` to run the `src/index.js` file.

An API key for LocationIQ is required to run the examples. Folks will need to set up a `.env` file locally to manage their API key.
